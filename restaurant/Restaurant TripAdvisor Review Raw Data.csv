Bread Street Kitchen,Dec-15,Week 49,Tuesday,1/12/2015,"""No 'wow' factor""","Maybe it was raised expectations, or the fame of the restuarant, was not particularly 'wowed' by my experience at this place. First we were ushered to high bar chairs for what is supposed to be a fine-dining meal, we of course asked to be re-seated at normal dinning tables. Staff in charge of sitting guests could be more attentive as we have to descend a flights of stairs to re-enter the restaurant again - albeit with one of us needing assistance. The duck dish was a bit too tough due to the thickness of the portion served, the steaks (sirloin n ribeye were a bit too raw even for medium), however the sea trout was nicely cooked. The portions were enough. The pineapple dessert was refreshing, the others were so so. Our waiter was however most attentive n helpful throughout our meal. He was properly the saving grace. Maybe we expected more, so this one time suffice for us, considering the price we paid for the experience.",3-May,Average,Yes,7/12/2015,6

If you are planning a trip to Singapore you must book a reservation at this restaurant. We were lucky enough to have lunch here and ?.. It beat all my expectations. I am a foodie; I am Italian and i love food. So having the chance to eat at a Gordon Ramsay?s Restaurant was pretty exciting. The bread they serve you while you wait for your meals was fresh and a great variety. The butter to go with the bread was AMAZING, I have never tasted butter like that before, it was full of flavour and silky smooth. I ordered the Beef Burger and my partner ordered the pork belly. Hands down one of the best meals we have ever had. The beef patty was so flavoursome, tender and cooked to complete perfection, the bun was soft and had all the right condiments inside as for the chips they were crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. You can tell the food is made with love and of the highest quality. For a simple Burger and Chips Bread Street Kitchen you have out done yourself.",5-May,Excellent,Yes,7/12/2015,5

There were time when we just walked in and they were very accommodating and managed to get us seats despite being crowded.

Bread Street Kitchen,Dec-15,Week 50,Thursday,10/12/2015,"""Top notch service and quality ingredients""","Bread Street Kitchen was very attentive during the reservation process, noting our specifications, and providing us seating that suited perfectly. From the confirmation call to the wait staff, attention to (personal) details really places the restaurant up there in terms of service. Despite BSK being a casual dining venue, and its location in Marina Bay Sands, I did not receive any snooty attitude at all, even from the caucasian staff. We also had a surprise sorbet with decoration to commemorate our special celebration there. Food wise, you can't knock a Gordon Ramsay brand. Take the unassuming 'traditional' Fish & Chips - the fish tasted like a cod, unlike any cheap fish used elsewhere for a deep-fried dish, it was meaty, with bite, and not flaky, definitely not lacking in texture and flavour, perhaps a tad too greasy. Batter was tasty. The only times I used the tartar sauce accompaniment was for the chips, and not the fish. My wife loved the wide-cut chips, but I didn't fancy it as much, as it got soft pretty quick (I do love double-fried shoestring fries). The smashed peas didn't do much for me, but it was easy to scoop up and eat I suppose. Downside is that the portion of fish was a bit small. The Dingley Dell Pork Belly was by far the best pork dish my wife has had all year. The meat was amazingly tender, flavourful and sweet without any 'porky' smell and the crackling was very crisp without any charred notes so common in roast pork. Perfectly salted as well, with a delicious apple dice and wholegrain mustard sauce on the side that really cut through the richness. Good portion size, and the complimentary bread basket and salted butter were excellent. And that Mac & Cheese classic. Heavenly. Again, the cheese is not your run of the mill cheese wiz. Rich, creamy and velvety cheese sauce blanketing the perfectly al dente macaroni. Well balanced so you get to indulge without feeling overly stuffed or guilty adding on a dessert to end off the meal. Hint of garlic adds taste interest to a simple dish. You will keep on eating it. Perhaps cos the macaroni was cut quite small. I think I over-ate on this. For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant. It was well baked with a good, slightly crisp crust that was easily breached with a tap of the spoon to reveal the deliciously molten, scaldingly hot interior. We gobbled it down despite it being steaming hot, the bittersweet chocolate offset by the mild mint ice cream was an irresistible combination. Exquisite experience - highly recommended.",5-May,Excellent,Yes,11/12/2015,1

Crawled my way back at 9pm and was in luck when there was a table for four. Ambience was good with views overlooking the promenade at street level. Ordered the Pork Belly, Risotto, Burger and Black Cod, Mac n Cheese and a bottle of wine. Thumbs up for the cod and MNC which was pretty good. Not forgetting spicy tune tartar. Rest were passable. Somehow, service was disappointing as the Caucasian service staff was pretty cold and we felt ""rushed"" with the order. The complimentary tartlets were too sweet to our liking.

I tried the set lunch - it was a good combination of starter, main -smoked haddock and salmon fish cake- and desert- blue bake well tart - choices were given. Lovely food. Excellent value! Hubby tried Irish aged rib eye steak. The staff were very attentive and asked us how we found the food.

Bread Street Kitchen,Dec-15,Week 50,Sunday,13/12/2015,"""Just Average""","Went to BSK Singapore for lunch last week. At least two out four of us are fans of Gordon Ramsay. Maybe our expectation was too high, but the BSK certainly did not impress us. We arrived pretty early, and ordered our food right away. The starters were served quickly. We really liked the Seared Scallops, but that's the only dish that everyone liked. The King Prawns were just so-so. For the mains, my BSK short rib burger was not bad, but my friend's roasted cod fish tasted like steamed fish, and the duck breast was pretty hard. We also shared a pork belly, the flavor was good, but the skin was too hard. For the dessert, the cheesecake has a strange texture, more like a pudding... Service was good at the beginning, but when the restaurant got busy, things slowed down, and one of our add-on order was forgotten. Some of my friends said they probably would not come back again.",3-May,Average,Yes,18/12/2015,5
Bread Street Kitchen,Dec-15,Week 51,Monday,14/12/2015,"""Nothing special at all""","We have lived around the corner from this restaurant since it opened and finally got around to trying it. Unfortunately the hype was not all it was cut out to be. I have dined at several of Ramsey's restaurants in other cities and I have never been disappointed. They are usually of the highest standard but Bread Street Kitchen failed to live up to the others. Having said that I should maybe have anticipated this as the price point for Singapore is quite low. I had the Rib eye and it was only $60. For Singapore that is very cheap, so to keep the prices low I'm sure the quality of the cut had to be compromised. The starters of Sea bass carpaccio and Pumpkin soup were also under seasoned. This restaurant is probably acceptable more for a business lunch than dinner. If you do go, stick to the classics like fish and chips which can be done well at the cheaper price. I would rather pay double the price and get the high quality I would expect from Gordon Ramsey than be disappointed, won't be going back to this restaurant but I will eat at some of his other establishments.",3-May,Average,Yes,18/12/2015,4

The restaurant seems to be modeled as a kind of tapas-y type of restaurant.. small dishes to go with drinks and not a place for full fledged dinner.

Bread Street Kitchen,Dec-15,Week 51,Tuesday,15/12/2015,"""Ramsay in Singapore - expect to pay handsomely""","My wife and I visited Ramsay's BSK at Marina Sands one Sunday lunchtime. The menu is quite reasonable and as many have written before, it's a mix of traditional British and local fare. This is a two storey restaurant and we were seated in the larger, busier, noisier section on L1. I would have preferred downstairs as it looks and feels a lot more intimate but for a Sunday brunch rather than an intimate dinner, it didn't really matter. The service throughout was very good. Attentive, present but not hanging around, they even managed that seemingly rare thing in local terms and provided the starters to start, the mains afterward with a nice break in between. A point many other restaurants have yet to learn. Now, food. We plumped for potted beef brisket with grain mustard, piccalilli and caraway crackers for me; seared scallops with carrot pur‚e, bacon, apple and celery cress to start. Both were excellent with the scallops beautifully cooked. I could have done without the crackers as they seemed superfluous but a small grumble in a good start. Our mains were a Ramsay variation of Shepherd's Pie and an Artichoke Risotto. The pie had a lot to live up to, it has long been a family favourite, one cooked at home from a very early age, and when done well is a great hearty meal. It also had the distinction of costing over $40.00 so it had to be good. Hmmm, not quite to be frank. The pie arrived in a small cast iron dish. It was red hot which is fair enough but it was lacking depth. The lamb was superbly cooked, tender and juicy. I just don't understand why the potato was being rationed. A thin topping wasn't enough for a luxury pie. On the other hand, the risotto that destroyer of Masterchef contestants, was spot on. A good portion perfectly cooked, you can't ask for more. All this was washed down by an expensive water and a good but pricey bottle of Prosecco. So, we walk away from Ramsay's with the thought that it was ok, not fantastic but worth a visit if for no other reason than to say ""I have dined there"". No repeat visit for us I suspect as there is better in Singapore but no regret in going. The food around us looked good and we all know well before we go to a star chef's restaurant that we will pay handsomely.",3-May,Average,Yes,18/12/2015,3

We heard alot of negative feedback about Bread Street Kitchen when it was just opened. However, it did not disappoint us. All our orders came out right and delicious. We were given an indoor long table because the haze was bad even though we only had 3 persons. There were 3 other customers sitting at the other end of the table. In between was another empty table.

We liked it enough to have two lunches here though the conclusion in the end was that the food is very average. The king crab melt, the hamachi shabu shabu and rice cakes were competent but underwhelming. The second time we ate here we ordered a a roast chicken dish that looks to have been removed from the menu - a good decision by the restaurant as the chicken was served with its feet on. When we enquired if that was a mistake, we were assured it was the intended presentation. Service could do with some polishing - you will likely get asked in quick succession by different waiters over the course of the meal whether you have ordered/are enjoying your meal/need anything else.

But when looking at romantic, intimate places my wife and I could go to for lunch I said ""let's try it!"" I was super excited to get a reservation and our adventure started! Firstly to get to the restraunt requires a very long walk through the marina bay sand shoppe which would normally irritate me...but this shopping centre is a tourist Mecca, it's array of speciality posh stores and even a waterway where you could be taken via rowboat through the shopping centre! Plus the long walk certainly stirs up the hunger juices! I was quite surprised when walking in to the restraunt at how small it was. For a ""celebrity restraunt"" at such a location you'd expect a large dining area, but no it was very small. Yet very intimate, with a beautiful city view which made us feel like we were the only people there (plus it was very empty). Firstly the only negatives I have (hence 4 not 5 stars) was some of staff service. I had read some pretty bad reviews on the staff on here and online and while they were extremely friendly and helpful they did do some interesting things. Firstly after ordering off the set menu, our entrees arrived promptly which was a delight yet there was a 20 minute break before the waitress came over and said ""I'm so sorry the kitchen didn't get your docket so it'll be 5 minutes for the food"". How can they serve the entrees without the docket hmm? The second course came about 20 minutes later (it was a pie so duh it wasn't going to take 5 mins to make). Also when we asked for the bill the same lady said ""I'm sorry we put you down for the 2 course set meal instead of the 3 course set, so you get the desserts for free"" which was cool but...how do you mix that up! Plus the place was super empty so it shouldn't have taken so long to bring the food out or misplace the docket. On the positive side, love the decor, one side your looking into the shopping centre at a big wall with huge photos of old singapore (I liked it) while the wife had the city view. The tables were a good space apart so when the table next to us was taken we were able to communicate without being disturbed by the people next to us. The food was great!

Excellent service. excellent quality. It is worth to eat US beef, Australian and in my opinion even better the Japanese. Also delicious appetizers especially the crab. Also very good desserts. I would say the price-quality ratio too low. First, it states that it is the first time I give an adverse opinion in the value for money in a restaurant of this level despite (without wanting to look modest but as you can deduce from my profile) I've tried many. Secondly that negative opinion comes from the fact that I too think that a meat dish (although the best quality in the world), cooked simply grilled and / or to the plate, it costs (about 200 EUR) more than twice a dish prepared by a chef three Michelin stars (whose second average is around 80 to 100 ?) !!

I recommend the mushroom risotto- it was so creamy and loaded with fresh mushrooms, and not too salty. My husband enjoyed burrata appetizer immensely. We both ordered fish- red snapper for him and sea bass for myself. Both were cooked perfectly and were not dry. If you're considering a fine dining experience in Singapore, look no further.

The Tuna Nicoise salad was made up of Tuna Confit, Tomatoes, Boiled Egg, Potatoes, Olives, Fine Beans and Tonnato Dressing. Light and not too heavy but enough to make it delicious yet healthy. The slow cooked salmon came with smoked bacon, brussels sprouts, marmalade, yellow potatoes and mustard velout‚. Nicely cooked and tender without making the salmon too dry for consumption.

Once we tasted the king crab melt & lobster roll, we were all praise and complimenting the dishes. The service was brilliant, the server introudced himself and gave good advice on whether we ordered enough dishes. On the menu, it also gives an sense of how much to order for 2 pax. They even portion the dishes in 4 pieces because there were four of us. I like the ambience and decor. After the meal, the walk to the carpark wasnt a drag in fact it was a welcome walk to burn of the sinful but delivious calories we accummulated.

Not really being used to more expensive restaurants, I was a bit surprised that the cheapest burger (well, they did indicate this place being a burger place from the outside, so I had to try a burger), was about S$30 (Frenchie Burger?) - and so I ordered it. I did like that this place served table water (yes, I'm cheap), and the food came fairly fast. I did like the burger, it was done medium rare as I had ordered (most places either over or under cook burgers), and they kindly agreed to give me salad instead of fries. It was a good burger on the whole, no real complains. It's probably not a place I would come all the way for, but if I was walking around MBS, I may step in to try the DB signature burger.

We were so looking forward to the place as we expected more from Chef Ramsey than Jamie Oliver's restaurant, especially on the food. First of all, we were quite disappointed that our reserved table was on the lower level of the restaurant where it's facing inside view of the MBS Mall and the open kitchen was nearby so the 'aroma' was not so pleasant - hair and clothings had food smell after walking out of the restaurant. We were actually expecting to be dinning upstairs where we can get the scenic view. Secondly, a slim, fair caucasian guy came to wait on our table and we asked him to recommended some dishes to us since it's our first visit there. Not only did he have a straight face (no smile from him - at least i never spotted any throughout the meal) but he tends to look at us in a not so friendly way (looking down on too-casually-dressed asians in a so-call celebrity fine dining restaurant maybe?) and spoke with an obvious snobbish tone. We nearly wanted to walk out of the place but end of the day, we wanted to give 'face' to Chef Ramsey as he seems such a nice & friendly celebrity so we tolerate since the other 2 ladies and an Indian guy (seems to be local) were so friendly and accommodating attending to us that made up for the negative attitude we 'suffered' earlier from SOMEONE. For example we intended to share food for that meal so when we asked him how big is the portion of the main course and he replied bluntly that 'I do not know how to tell/explain to you but in Europe we do not share food' ... duh... The food in general was somehow decent only but the cut meat we felt are too thick (eg. the duck breast). For the starter - pan fried scallops was to my liking though, perfectly done and the mashed potato was silky & smooth so that was good too. Will I recommend to my family and other friends? NO Will I visit again? NO i felt more 'at home' and cheerful when I visited Jamie's Italian twice though the food was not fantastic, i went back for the environment and atmosphere of that restaurant as I was willing to give them another chance to try more of the food.and furthermore their staffs were way more friendlier during my visits - ALL OF THEM!

Wine by the glass is $20++ and above. Lunch menu was interesting and innovative comparing to other bistros in Marina Bay Sands, which is good. The food wasn't quite up to what we expected.

The prices on CUT's menu easily rate as one of the most expensive among steakhouses in sg, so we are definitely expecting top quality food, service and experience here. The service is mostly excellent and attentive with the occasional banter. We enjoyed the Service. However, some restaurants in the same category offer a little bit more for special occasions like photos, complimentary champagne (we gotten ours through our citibank privilege) or dessert. Hence, CUT falls a little short here. The Steak is surely good, but not excellent for the price asked. We could recommend other restaurants that could do better steak then CUT at slightly lower prices. Atmosphere is mostly enjoyable, even though it's crowded but a little noisy. Hence I would rate CUT 4 stars for service, 3.5 stars for atmosphere, 3 stars for food (relative to its price, and what other equivalent restaurants charge for equal quality food), and 3 stars for waiting time as it took longerv than expected.

My friend came afterwards and ordered her favourite Funghi Misti but to her disappointment, the pizza was incredibly salty too. I tried it myself and realised the saltiness was in the mushrooms, and we feedback to the manager. Instead of responding objectively, she was extremely defensive: 1) She commented it must be because there was too much cheese. We said no, we don't think it is the problem with the cheese because we can tell the whole pizza was just oddly too salty. 2) She claims she has been selling this since morning and no one complained. Excuse me? Just cos no one complained doesn't mean there is nothing wrong. 3) We told her her response was very defensive, but she skirted the topic and maintained no one complained. We didn't want to argue so decided to let it slide. 4) After we paid for the bill, another waitress served us our change and told us we had TWENTY CENTS change. We were appalled with the attitude!

The other pizzas - brussel sprouts, burrata, meat,... where okay, but when you start adding brussel sprouts and things like that, you start looking and tasting a little bit like a California Pizza Kitchen (don't get me wrong Mozza was NOT CPK, even Mozza's most non-standard pies were good, just not great). When you load too much on the pie, it takes away from the crust - the crust gets a little softer/wetter in the middle. This is probably the best pizza I have ever tasted in Asia, hands down.

I usually would check the reviews on Tripadvisor or Hungrygowhere before visiting a new restaurant but since this is Gordon Ramsay, one would expect nothing less than excellence. Boy, was I disappointed. We ordered 3 starters, seared scallops, tamarind chicken wings and salmon ceviche. The serving for the seared scallops was very small, 3 tiny scallops on bland carrot puree. The chicken wings have good seasoning but very dry. The salmon ceviche was simple slices of salmon with grapefruit juice, nothing memorable. The entrees were equally disappointing. We ordered the grilled parrot fish and roasted duck breast. The parrot fish tasted ordinary, no wow factor. The duck breast was tough, the kale was not a good pairing because it gives the dish a bitter taste. Overall, on a scale of 1-10, I'd give the dishes a 3. Desserts. The fondant was ok, but the chocolate brownie didn't taste much. I wasn't kidding when I said ""didn't taste much"" because it tasted like cardboard. No sweetness, no chocolate flavor, the most tasteless desserts I've ever had. Service was relatively good but it doesn't compensate for the poor quality of food. This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to. And for the price of close to $100 per person, one would expect something decent.

The baby chicken looked like a science experiment gone wrong. One slice of the knife reveals the grossly undercooked bird. It looks malignant and was so disturbing. How was the fish? Who knows? All I could taste was glop. Too many other things weren't good enough. And the mark-up! The cheapest main on the menu is fish and chips for $26. The issue is less the exact numbers, but whether you end up looking at a dish and questioning the value. Here you do. The compelling sense is that Ramsay, probably England?s most famous chef, draped in Michelin stars, has no feel for this end of the market; and that his name, tarnished or not, is not enough to rescue this sterile venture from sublime irrelevance.

Ate about 12 or 13 items because we decided to share and sample stuff (there is also a tasting menu for those who go in pairs or smaller groups). Each item was so unique ... something you will very likely not get in another place. The salmon sashimi had parmesan drizzled on it and melted in the mouth.

We have been to a few Wolfgang Puck restaurants in US before. Other then famous among Hollywood celebrities, he is not really that famous - for his food. And it was no exception this time round. The restaurant is at 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. One have to take the Tower 2 elevators to 55th floor and change to another one to get to it. A little inconvenient to get to. Good thing they also have a reception on 1st floor to advise guest how to get to it. Restaurant setting is pleasant, kind of European style and not too cramp. we were seated at the side that facing Gardens by The Bay, though view is kind of obstructed by planters outside the restaurant. For my friend birthday celebration, we ordered 2 Glass of French 2010 Chateau Thebaud White recommended by our waiter. We are not wine specialist but we thought it was fine. Our waiter didn't introduce himself though. We shared 4 dishes: - Burrata & Marinated Brussels S$29. It was nice but serving size is wanting. - 'Fruitti de Mare' Maine Lobster Risotto. S$72(Entree size). Nice but no exceptional. - Pan Seared Red Snapper 'Laksa' S$58. More like fried Snapper with nice crispy skin, and they got the right 'Laksa' taste! It was nice! - Dutch Milk-Fed Veal Chop S$88. Cooked medium as order. Good. 2 Side Dishes. Both S$18. Serving size are good for sharing. - Dahl Cauliflower. OK. - Fingerling Potatos 'Patatas Bravas'. OK too. We think our waiter forgot our order, waited for quite sometime. We saw him entered it to the computer after we reminded him. Minus point here. S$400 plus, including our White Wine. For a fine dining restaurant, I consider Spago average (I am being nice!). Food not great, service mediocre. Our waiter missed one of our order, and we were basically neglected when a guests of a big table arrived. It also took quite sometime before we get our bill! After we clear our bill, my friend took a picture of their logo just outside the restaurant. One of their receptionist who happened to walk pass, asked us ""Can I help YOU!"" in a bit of a hostile tone, as if we are some gate crushers! I am quite sure we were dress to the occasion. So I told her my friend just want a picture with their famous logo, and we just finish our dinner at their restaurant. She realised her mistake, broke into Singlish ""Sori, Sori, Sori!"", and scoot off quickly. Well, I'm sorry too! It would have been nicer if she apologise and offer to show us around, like their lounge! I would not recommend this restaurant.

We said yes to all options! The service, food and ambience is 2nd to none and had the most lovely feeling about it. It's quiet, no music and we were whispering, it all added to the feel and experience. The food is stunning and has so much quality, each of the 10 courses and 3 deserts, were world class and were presented in a way that even foodies like my wife were forced to take pics of each meal. All the photos shown are a true reflection of the amazing attention to detail they show on every step of your experience. It was like a performance, as you watch them prepare most of the courses right in front of you and we were sorted with just 2 other couples, but still felt very private as they speak to each group separately and we never feel like a group or anything. It was the one booking we made well in advance of course and planned and we do not regret it. We took to the 2nd sitting at 8:30pm so I suggest to watch the laser show first, then hot the casino for a look and then to dinner. It's all a few mins walk from each over. This place deserves its popularity and demand and we are impressed and delighted to encourage people to make this a special occasion experience. We will never forget his meal and their attention to detail.",5-May,Excellent,No,,
Waku Ghin,January,Week 4,Wednesday,20/1/2016,"""All the gourmet food you can think of!""","I've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney and I loved it so I was very excited to go to the one in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the new trendy hotel, Marina Bay Sands. It was around 5 minutes walk from the hotel and it was closer to Casino and the shops and the restaurant was on the second floor. Welcomed warmly by the staff, we sat in the very private room in front of the teppanyaki grill. We ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate the night ($50 per glass, the drinks are very expensive) and the chef brought out all the ingredients that they were going to use. The menu was not on the website and they don't give it to you till the end of the night (this part was the same as the Tetsuya's in Sydney). The menu included carpaccio of flounder with bitter salad, marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar (signature dish), slow cooked New Zealand John Dory with charcoal grilled eggplant, puree of potato with soft poached egg (onset eggs) truffle and caviar, warm salad of abalone with asparagus and Chinese olive, braised Canadian lobster with tarragon, Japanese wagyu (Shiga, and it was A5 rank) with fresh wasabi and ponzu, and then a rice or a noodle dish to finish then gyokuryo (highest quality green tea) and two desserts. Overall, amazing food and service, I enjoyed a nice interaction with the chef. When you pay $450 per person, it's a bit hard to get something wrong. Everything was perfect. The sommelier was knowledgeable, we had a lovely cocktail made by a very polite bar person and our floor staff was very attentive. The hard thing for these restaurant is that people have different expectations so if one small thing goes wrong or it's not what they were expecting, people do get very disappointed. The food was cooked to perfection and I couldn't fault the service. Tetsuya is a world known chef and I loved his food. A lot more seafood compared to Sydney and I would have to say that the food was more Japanese then the one in Sydney. I had a glass of sake after the champagne instead of wine but I would recommend wine with the meal as well. They have a great extensive list of sake and wine and the sommelier is there to give you any advise. It's a once in a life time experience, but if you go, don't expect anything and just enjoy the night. Ask questions to the chef, they are more than happy to explain anything if you are interested. It's an amazing experience no questions asked about that.",5-May,Excellent,No,,

Not the most elaborate preparations but the dishes are appealing and very enjoyable. Fresh ingredient and elegantly prepared. Celebrity Chef David Myers come and check on the restaurant frequently and personally greet guests. The serving staff are all extremely friendly.

For my 2nd visit the menu was exactly the same, did chef Tetsuya built his reputation with 1 menu, with only 8courses? The answer on my last trip.... YES!!! SERIOUSLY..... Almost the same menu with the same display... But now the worst is the confidence and the arrogance of your teppan ""chef"" that assumed they don't have to do the job as the reputation is established in the 50best.

Desserts were excellent; the monkey shoulder cheesecake (which came with a complimentary candle and birthday song from the staff) and chocolate fondant. I guess we started well and ended well. :) On a side note, though the prices are a tad more expensive (we spent around $180 for two), this is more than made up for by the complimentary bread, little touches like the ketchup in a jar from wilkin & sons, and attentive service.

Upon entereing the place we actually first thought about to just have a drink in the lounge close to the bar but then decided to have dinner as planned. This - unfortunately was a big mistake. The food was fine and of good quality. We were told that the actual chef has been trained in France. What was most discomfortable was the extremely ""cool"" atmosphere. Not only the interior design was rather uninspired and did not at all fit such a remarkeable location. What was disturbing most and made us feel extremely uncomfortable was the AC which was way too low. It was the cappucino at the end that was the most warming about our stay at Sky on 57. The worst was to come after that. Just before leaving the place I went to wash my hands in the bathroom. It seems that one of the persons tried to come after me since they mistook me for a tourist that only wanted to use the restaurants premises. Fortunately my wife cought the person and explained to her that we actually also have spent money in the restaurant (and it was quite a lot of money for what we have been served). And our bad experience was not even finished yet. Since we have chosen the place for its location I stepped out on the restaurants terrace to take some pictures of the bay.

Though the manager offered his apology, the damage had been done and we opted to go somewhere where our business would be appreciated and we could enjoy ourselves.

But felt that it had been frozen some time and too firm. not as fresh or succulent as it should be. The sauce was literally full of horse radish and was super spicy. Both of us nearly choked on the sauce as it was too strong. The menu said that the sauce was ""home made cocktail sauce and lemon"" . Nowhere does it say strong horse radish sauce. The bread basket was cold. This was a particular no no for me as I consider this a 5 star restauarnt and expect them to serve freshly baked bread. CUT and MOZZA next door had no such problem. For mains, we had the signature DB Burger and Coq Au Vin. I only finished half of the burger as it was really bland and tasteless. The patty was supposed to be made with sirloin and foie gras. But it is rather dry and tasteless. The irony is that the burger bun and fries tasted better than the patty. Big Mac probably had more taste. The chicken was very tender indeed but it was literally tasteless as well. Similarly we had the Burgundy Escargot. It too was very bland and I just could not taste the Escargot, nor the garlic or pesto. Overall, service was ok and quick. But the dishes were a big let down.

Service and welcome - Right up there with other GR joins in the UK. Pleasant, well turned-out and groomed, smiley and professional. Aperitifs - I had a vodka martini and my date Prince of Julep (?) - both were very good, no complaints. The PoJ was very interesting and if you like cardamom and bitters I would seriously recommend it! Food - we had the BSK meat/cold cuts platter to start followed by black cod for my date and the artichoke risotto for me, and the Monkey Shoulder (whiskey) infused cheesecake to share for desert. The food was quite simply put - Excellent - in particular the risotto remained a perfect consistency from start to finish (and I am not a quick eater) which is something that is not easily accomplished. The cheesecake IMO could have been a little more Monkey Shouldery - but then we do like our whiskey. Wine - the only negative, eye-wateringly expensive - we had a bottle on the lower end of the price range (a well known Lebanese red - the Chateau Musar Hochar 2009) and it more than doubled our bill for the evening. Whilst one gets accustomed to this (tragically) in Singapore and in particular in prime locations such as Orchard Rd, Dempsey HIll and MBS - I still believe that restaurants can do better on this. This sort of mark-up (250-300%) is no longer a question of import taxes, duties or storage. We love our wine and would almost always have a 2nd bottle on any nice dinner out - but not for silly money. Verdict - I'd certainly come back for the food and the cocktails but will have to think hard about wine options.

It was no different to the quality of an English Breakfast that you would get in any suburban corner cafe in Sydney.

From there, it was cocktails, excellent grissini and a choice of really lovely breads all baked on the premises. Of course, we couldn't resist the steak choices which we actually thought were really quite reasonably priced for Singapore. We started with a shared salad (heirloom apple with fennel and waldorf dressing) which they divided into two plates for us. Then we absolutely relished the steaks, and totally over-ordered (happily so) on the sides, with brussell sprouts and smashed potatoes and broccolini. I couldn't fault a thing. If only we could have managed dessert; the lovely staff brought out a small cake with candle in any case. Plus, they correctly judged that my husband would hate a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" sung to him, so wisely just presented the cake and candle, and left us to it. The service was genuinely as good as it gets in Singapore. Sadly, service here even at the highest-end establishments can be really woeful. Not here. Staff are well-briefed, know what they are doing, read their tables well, and provided perfect, unobtrusive but personalised and very warm service.

The ambiance is great but if you look out the window you see all the hotel guests in bathing suits and the like jumping in and out of the infinity pool which is just in front of the restaurant. That makes the view obviously very nice on top of MBS. The main negative point here is for sure the staff: in such a place with such a reputation and history, half of the staff are dragging their feet and making noises while doing that, quite typical in Singapore but not what you would expect in this kind of upmarket place. Some of the staff were also not very friendly, short and a bit rude in talking to you and one was maybe an intern or so (but without the intern badge you ususally see in these cases) because she was really not ready to talk to guests but still she did, having no idea of the menu and speaking with an enormously Singaporean accent not trying to make herself understood to us.

The pork chop with fennel, onion and samba, as well as whole sea bream with bergs and extra olive oil are highlights. Apple borsellino with caramel gelato & whipped cream fruit provides a stunning, textured finish to a sensational meal. Italian wines compliment each course perfectly.

We ordered the veal carpaccio for starters and the beef short ribs burger and shepherds pie for mains. While the veal was nice and refreshing, the burger and Shepherds pie were really ordinary.

One can understand that the temperature of the food is right 2 times 3times 10 times even. That the butter or the meat or the avocado is consistent those many times. But what do you do for the human element called service. Even celebrity stars who are paid to smile have not achieved consistency in smiling and at the lower end of the system in hospitality to achieve the consistency of genuine smile and impeccable warm and efficient service is very difficult with long hours and stretching your facial muscles continuously. I cannot overlook the food consistency because of my very restrictive diet and neither can I overlook service. I can at times overlook the food but not service. I have gone atleast 70 times if not more to Bread Street Kitchen.

It's not just 'popping down to the hotel restaurant'!) From the moment we entered the restaurant, it was a fantastic experience. The staff were fantastic (in particular, Marvin, our waiter), attentive, but not intrusive. The bread sticks and bread selection are outstanding. I'm still dreaming about the pretzel rolls - I'd happily pay $50 another one! We had the Australian Porterhouse for two, which was carved and served table side. It was outstanding and cooked to perfection. The Mac & Cheese is also incredible! For dessert we ordered the Valrhona Chocolate Souffl‚, which the waitress brought out and added the accompaniments to at the table. We don't drink wine, so didn't take much notice of the wine list, other than it was extensive! While, yes, it is an expensive meal, for our special occasion we felt it was worth every cent.

We ate on the Osteria side of the restaurant which has a large black marble bar in the centre which you can eat at. The other half of the restaurant is a pizzeria which is much more informal, no table clothes etc and the tables much closer together. The wine list is excellent and we had a bottle of Barolo which was amazing. The waiters were very knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu and were able to offer good recommendations. My main course pasta dish and pudding were both delicious. Now the not so good..... When we arrived our table wasn't ready so we were asked to take a seat at the bar and have a drink there while we waited. This would have been absolutely fine but it took so long for someone to come and take our drinks order that we were shown to our table before our drinks arrived at the bar. I chose a starter from the mozzarella bar which was burrata served with prosciutto. What actually arrived though was a plate of prosciutto with a disproportionately small amount of cheese in the middle. While both ingredients were tasty they hadn't been dressed with any oil etc so were a little dry. The whole atmosphere in the restaurant is quite stiff. While the waiters are very knowledgable the service is way too formal and it makes it feel as though the restaurant is trying to be something it isn't. Although the food is good, we're not talking Michelin quality here and I've had more affable service at 3 star Michelin restaurants. My husband wanted to order a pizza for his main course but we were told this wasn't possible as we weren't sitting in the pizzeria side of the restaurant. It's just all a little too pretentious without the food standards to match.

I do not feel the staff here co-ordinate well either because out of all the fine dining restaurants I have attended I hardly ever notice waiters and they are rarely on your table.. I don't think anybody needs or wants 4 different waiters to slave away 20 times backwards and forwards to our little table. 2) I feel that this venue does not represent Gordon Ramsay's talents at all, it has a franchise feel to it not so much fine dining.

It is a somewhat fusion Japanese venue, or they are serving a mix of Japanese foods plus some western dishes. I think they only serve a fixed menu of the day during dinner hours. We had many present surprises with the foods that they served, starting from the very first course. For the entire dinner, there were only 2 or 3 courses that were less impressive; nevertheless, still tasted ok. One of the most unexpected surprises was the noodle in a cold soup with lime juice taste; it was such a refreshing dish after the heavy meal (before the deserts). The only drawback that I could think of was its price tag, approx. S$700+ per head. Nevertheless, you are getting back what you paid through the services that they provided and the foods that they served.

And here is where it gets confusing, some of their main dishes were great and other were below average. Their trout was amazing but their fish and chips were bland , and honestly I've had much better for less than half the price. Also one of our fish and chips arrived slightly raw on the inside. Which was a weird slip-up.Their main courses were on the smaller side. And on a design note it was really odd that their menu used a font that looked and felt similar to comic sans, which is weird choice that didnt go with the whole feel of the place, and seemed at odds with their original logo and branding. Overall we've honestly experienced much better places for the same price range. Though they do have some good things going for it (try their wings, loved their squashed peas and they have yummy ketchup) , they still left much to be desired (serving undercooked raw food, small portions , and some dishes were just not that great).

But in the long run it might affect a brand when the quality delivered is far less than promised. I will probably never go back to a Bread Street Kitchen in whatever country. Reason is the underwhelming experience in just made in Singapore. Starting with a rather poor door service. We were sat on the bar with the promise to get a table as soon as there is a vacancy. But we were forgotten and only after several reminders we finally got a table. Apologies: zero. The service stayed bad all way through dinner. Cocktail was taken away before finished, main course arrived very late, side dishes were not delivered at all and we had to remind. Again no apologies from the service people at all. Culminating in our credit card taken as we wanted to pay and not returned for 10 minutes without any explanation.

For starters we had the Aburi Tasmanian petuna ocean trout with a hint of chili and the Lobster sandwich. They were good and refreshing though calling it the Lobster sandwich a sandwich was a total misunderstanding of the word sandwich. It was just lobster meat in a bisque with two pieces of toasted bread on the side. Next came the Spaghetti with lobster and Spaghetti with king crab. They were both good but unexciting, with no highlights to stimulate our taste buds. They could use a better quality of pasta. The third movement came with Grilled wagyu beef on rice, a very tasty and favoursome offering and the Marinated tuna (Tonbo) set on seasoned rice. Compared with the Grill beef rice, this was really a let down. The seasoned rice is dominated by the vinegar used in the seasoning. The rice was too mushy for our taste. For drinks, we had Negroni, Waku Ghin martini and a Waku Ghin citrus. All tasty and exciting drinks to go with the food. However what stand out is the baby peach cured in truffle oil. An excellent accompaniment to the martini. Each bite explodes with favours. However, there was one on the mushy side, indicating a spoilt baby.

The restaurant is up on the 57th Floor of MBS so you're there in a jiffy given how fast the lift is. Staff then show you to your table in what is a surprisingly large restaurant with one USP being that you walk past people swimming in the hotel's Infinity pool. Once you're seated in the restaurant you realize how clever the construct and d‚cor are: you don't really see the hotel residents any more. Instead you have a tranquil view of Singapore on both sides and at the other you have a view of palm trees. The restaurant is light and airy - overall a very Californian feel. Chic but relaxing. I was quite impressed by the food as well. I had a set lunch one day and was gobsmacked by the portions. The pasta as a starter is more than enough for one and the chicken that I ordered comprised four generous pieces. There was no way that I could finish it and the staff weren't at all sniffy as they offered me to put the leftovers in the doggie bag - an offer I happily took up. By the way, they added that plenty of people get through not only a two-course meal but a four-course meal. In any case, $55 for a two-course meal of this quality was reasonable I felt. If I have any criticism, I think the front staff who guide you to your table could be a little friendlier. On both instances that I visited they were icy cold. Perhaps it's a language issue - but that's in stark contrast to the staff inside the restaurant who could not be more friendly and obliging.",4-May,Very Good,No,,

We received most of our food within 15 minutes, although for some reason, the fish & chips came almost 10 minutes after the rest. We suspect someone missed something. The taste and quality of the food was good enough for us to overlook the late arrival of the fish & chips. Portions were generous but not too large.

Perhaps....after all, the dishes did feature all the premium ingredients - truffles, caviar, lobster, wagyu beef... There's hardly a weak dish (for me it was the abalone, which was rather rubbery). Even the simplest-looking dish like a bowl of cold japanese noodle can be impressive. And of course you pay for the showmanship, as many of the dishes are cooked right in front of you. All the staff were professional and informative, including the Japanese chef in our room who explained each dish (he spoke excellent English). Drinks were very expensive (water for S$ 20++ !), and even having a glass of cocktail and another glass of wine could add to your bill substantially. But I think Waku Ghin could afford to be less rigid, and offer cheaper options for the set menu. In many fine dining restaurants, some premium ingredients are offered as optional supplements. After all, not everyone is crazy for caviar (or truffles, for that matter).

The second visit, we had Bloomsdale and Fennel Sausage. The Fennel Sausage is a tad heavy and oily. We also tried the lasagne al forno which we found superb! Very light with many layers and good amount of beef. My mother-in-law (who makes mouthwatering and delicious lasagne) was also impressed with the lasagne al forno. The service however is a little sketchy. We had to request for chilli flakes several times before it was served and the staff mixed up our order once.

Charred has a subtle smokey charcoal taste whereas burnt food is carbonized and will obviously taste bitter. I spoke to the waitress and pointed out that the octopus was over grilled and burnt. Instead of apologizing she said I am supposed to eat it with the salad so that it will not taste bitter. Indeed it was so bitter that I had finished the salad before the last 2 pieces of the octopus. I have eaten at all the so called celebrity restaurants in Singapore and I have yet to encounter such food and such bad service in a high end restaurant.

The initial ""welcome"" from our server was positively underwhelming and we wondered if we should leave but decided to persevere as the food looked good; unfortunately things did not improve. Asking questions about the menu is obviously not de rigeur here, likewise declining the offered Prosecco and opting for a craft beer instead. The food which was reassuringly expensive was a tale of 2 halves, mine (Butter Lettuce followed by Iberico Pork) with was nice but not exceptional, sadly the side of Rosemary potatoes tasted and looked like they may have been cooked earlier in the day. The options chosen by my wife (Bufala Mozzarela with Condimenti followed Butternut Squash Mezelune) were not good at all. If trading standards has any meaning her choice from the ""Mozarella Bar"" should be more correctly renamed as Condimenti with Mozarella, not exactly sure what was in the Mezelune dish as neither of us could detect much of anything apart from gnocchi (possibly) and olive oil.

We chose pizza but it was full so had chose pasta as she was hungry. The ambience and deco in the place is nice, chic, dim. Probably good for a first date impression.

Can't they have a line of English description about what's in the dish? Can't expect the wait staff to explain the whole menu to the guest, right? It's quite ridiculous. We ordered pasta...

Yes, there's an option for a large portion.. But the price of the ""regular"" pasta is already $26+++ should I just be satisfied with the measly portion? No! I expect a proper plate portion of food! Additional price would be for the really hungry! The meal was disappointing.

The food was delicious and cannot be faulted by any account. The waitstaff and chef asked if we had any dietary requirements and would tailor the menu accordingly if we did have any. We didn't and was blessed to experience the wide variety of fresh seafood that this restaurant featured. For me, the most outstanding dish was their signature marinated Botan shrimp with Sea urchin and Oscietra caviar (don't have a separate picture unfortunately) and for my partner, the lobster (see picture below) was a standout. We both agreed that the Wagyu was the best that we've tasted (picture also below). My expectation was that there would only be one chef's table that seated 10 - 12 people, but they actually have 4 rooms, each with their (teppanyaki-style) grill. Although that did not impact the excellent service in any way, I didn't expect there to be multiple chefs serving multiple tables. Perhaps if you are considering going here, go with friends or family that fill up one room (our room would seat 6 people) so service and your experience is seamless, i.e. not impacted by your neighbouring diners. For me, this restaurant is a once in a lifetime experience as it is very expensive, and in Singapore there's also a 10% service charge and a 7% tax on top of the bill. I would consider it one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and would cost at least approximately SGP$500 per person. If you add drinks, it can easily be more than that.

When it arrived at the table it looked amazing, however when I broke into the pastry I was disappointed to see that there was very little of the actual pie in the dish.

Most of the food was pretty good too, especially the pizzas which have a super thin, crispy base and juicy toppings. The ""diavolo chicken wings"" we're a bit big and not anything like ""buffalo wings"" (in case that's what you're after). The arancini balls in a bolognese sauce was more ""tomato sauce"" and a bit bland. Peroni is $15 a bottle. And the service was a bit hit and miss. It started great and then got sparse and then neglectful. We had to chase down the bill in the end even though we'd been asked to vacate the table by a certain time. All up, it was an expensive early dinner although there were good bits and we mainly enjoyed the food.

Bread Street Kitchen,April,Week 16,Monday,11/4/2016,"""Pricey restaurant, slightly overrated""","I had brunch here on a relatively quiet Saturday morning. I was surprised that there were hardly any patrons at around 12pm - most people started trickling in around 1pm+. FOOD: We ordered a total of 4 dishes and 2 non-alcoholic drinks to share between two people. The total bill came up to over S$100. I have to say for this price, the food was incredibly overwhelming. The open face omelette with mushrooms was bland, badly in need of seasoning and uninspiring. Basically a bare omelette sitting on plate. Great. I could have done that at home with tastier results. The scallop appetiser had prettier plating but again, very uninspired and didn't taste particular fresh or succulent. The watermelon-avocado salad was interesting but the balsamic glaze was overwhelmingly tart, and didn't feel balanced with the sweet watermelon flavours. Dessert was the peanut-caramel-chocolate bar (which reminded me of a huge Mars bar). It was actually the only saving grace of the meal with its sticky-sweet gooeyness... but it was let down when served with a side of already-melted coconut sorbet which tasted nothing like coconut and was running all over the plate. I guess it was left sitting on the counter a little too long. Oh, the complimentary bread basket and butter was nice. But that's not saying much is it? Our fruit juices were also very sweet and thick. Not sure if they were really freshly squeezed or from syrups given how thick they were but I didn't bother to ask this time. SERVICE: Unlike many other reviews I've read, I found the service fast, efficient and very friendly. We were served by about 5 different people over our meal but at least they all did what they were supposed to! No complaints. AMBIENCE: Modern New York-style feel, with lots of metals, mirrors and tiles. Would probably be a nice place to go to in the evening for a loud dinner with friends. Overall, very underwhelming food and I expected much better from a 'celebrity chef restaurant'.

The cheese stuffed foccacia was stunning, the burrata Pugliese as good as I have had in Puglia. But to me the star was the humble calamari fritti. I only ordered it, because it's the bog standard and I wanted to see how it would be. It was truly outstanding; tender squid, thin, crispy batter and then a light, lemony almost syrupy sauce, lightly enhancing the whole dish. And then the main courses arrived: The tortellini in brodo. Instead of a light, gentle broth, we got a monster of dark, much too deep and almost thickened soup, the tortellini were heavy, completely over salted (and I like a good dose of salt). This is a dish that can normally be served to a recovering consumptive, but this interpretation could have killed a cow. The pork chop was beautifully done, juicy and tender, but then it was covered with a thick layer of herbs and whatnot and sat in a heavy sauce that was completely unnecessary. All the 6 dishes I tasted, including the duck ragu pasta and the overcooked bream suffered the same problem: Too much flavour. The chef needs to realise when it is time to leave well enough alone. There is a point in which any further reduction of flavours becomes counterproductive and our chef last night passed that point and continued running. So we are left with a problem: Starters we will dream about and mains we want to try and forget.

I had trouble with paying this much food for essentially minimally cooked ingredients. After receiving my Visa statement, I still don't think this was worth it but I am glad I tried it. The restaurant is beautiful. You are seated at individual stations with maximum 8 guests. I found it strange that they were so insistent on us arriving on time as the whole room eats together and yet a couple arrived about 45 minutes into our meal and had an abbreviated version of our dinner. It was off-putting simply because they were SO annoying about the time issue beforehand. The food was good but because it is seasonal, you have no say in what you eat. Therefore instead of the salt smoked Alaskan king crab (which I can also get at home but is still a treat), we were served Atlantic lobster, which I grew up eating fresh out of the sea every summer. Needless to say, no matter how fresh it was before it got on the plane, it's not going to taste as good as in Canada. The signature dish was very tasty. Unlike my expectations, there is some sort of marinade (the chef confirmed it) to the shrimp so it is not just a pile of raw ingredients as some critics have suggested. Dessert is served in a lounge with a view and was very nice French style chocolates and cakes.

Pan seared, JQ?s foie gras xiao long bao and Wild mushrooms with truffle jus Maine Lobster ? Wok fried, coated with ochazuke arare. Asian greens and JQ?s straits sweet and sour chili sauce Australian M5 Wagyu Trip Tip ? Char grilled steak with asparagus, uni butter and Bonito infused yuzu pepper sauce Citrus Heaven ? Marinated citrus lime sponge, orange mouse, Orange gel, fennel confit and tangerine sorbet The entire menu was accompanied by a glass of selected wine, beer or a non-alcoholic alternative. The first three courses were really wonderful. But never having eaten Wagyu beef before, I was expecting a supremely tender and flavoursome steak. I subsequently learned that tri-tip is a cut of beef from the bottom sirloin, and is not one of the prime cuts. So although I enjoyed the flavour, my steak was slightly ?chewy? - and no better than an equivalent cut from a less prestigious breed of cattle. My dessert was a combination of tiny ?bits and pieces?, including sponge cake, and jelly, etc. Frankly, it was rather ordinary. This dinner was included in a tour package, so I cannot comment upon the price - although I am sure it wasn't cheap. However, spectacular views from the top of Marina Bay Sands provide sufficient reason to visit Sky on 57 for dinner, even if the costs reflect the premier location. Furthermore, there is no better place to watch the ?Wonder Full at Marina Bay Sands? laser light show, which starts at 8:00 pm.

Of course I do not have a problem with pouring my own wine at all, but when you are paying a certain high price for the '5 star dining experience', you hope they come over a few more times than just taking your order and bringing you the bill. The tables surrounding being treated like celebrities, it was actually quite amusing to watch how the staff acted differently depending on what menu you chose.

It was planned to have a fine dining experience and someone had mentioned Sky on 57, so it was a good option. Plus had chance to see local celebrity chef Justin Quek. It was easy and straight forward to make a reservation online, and on arrival they had my reservation in the books and was shown to out table next at the window with a great view. We had time browse through the menu, which I had seen online, but was told of the business set lunches were available too. We both went for a 4 course set with a starter, soup, main and dessert. $65 per person. A great selection of bread was offered and was offered more once we finished. Declined the second offering as we didn't want to fill up on bread. First course: Foie Gras Xiao Long Bao, Organic Egg with slow cooked Iberico Pork Belly and Braised Leek. Both dishes were great, but the flavour that came from the Foie Gras in the Xiao Long Bao stood out by a mile. Amazing. Soup: Double cooked pork broth, Artichoke Veloute. The double cooked broth is a fusion soup, but definitely felt more Chinese style. The options on the menu were very much a mixture of local dishes and western. Illustrated in our main course. Main Course: Roasted Lamb Shoulder, Fish Curry. The lamb was cooked perfectly, great flavour and tender. Fish curry was a play on the local Fish head curry, was good. Not very spicy, and the fish you could tell was quite fresh. I was left wondering what fish was used, I couldn't really tell. It did wasn't a fish had a strong fish flavour. Dessert: We took a range of different desserts from the dessert trolley. Coffee to finish off a fantastic meal. Service was fantastic. Faultless, waiting staff new how to present each dish as they came, water was constantly filled, and everyone was friendly and walked around with a smile. We were quite full by the end of it, so walked it off with a hit if window shopping in the mall below.

My friend's Black Cod lived up to expectations. I then had the cheesecake which was whiskey based with blueberry ice cream. It was very good but not exceptional. My friend had the banana sponge pudding which she said was a bit dry. But all in all we enjoyed our meals. We had a glass each of a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc which was good but my friend commented after we had left that her serving was actually smaller than mine. I hadn't noticed. The restaurant is in a nice setting along the waterfront and can be accessed from the outside or from within the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall.

We wanted to order oysters just like another table next to us she said they donot have anymore so we ordered drinks. Half an hour later a group walked it and ordered oysters and voila there appeared OYSTERS!!! I was disgusted by the way we were treated because I thought it was a place that had different service/ food for different clientele!!! I think the locals and customers that stay at the hotel get the special treatment! We paid $60 for 2 drinks and walked away in disgust. I made sure I told them that customers should be treated with respect. Horrible place and not worth the visit. views are only of container ships waiting in the sea.

The food is generally of high quality but there is really nothing special about it. I had the set dinner menu, available before 7pm. For S$58+++, you get a 2 course meal. I ordered the kale caesar salad which I loved. The anchovy dressing paired well with the crunchy kale. The second course was the slow cooked salmon, which was cooked perfectly but the sauce accompanying it was a little too rich. After a few mouthfuls, I could not continue with the dish. Dessert we ordered a la carte and that was disappointing. I've had my fair share of chocolate lava cake and this one just did not make the grade. It was ordinary, to say the least and I really hated the caramel sauce. There was just too much sweet in one dish. The service was really so-so. The staff are not rude but they were not warm and welcoming. The word that comes to mind is perfunctory. No recommendations were made; there was little attention to detail that one would expect from a restaurant in this location, and they let the cat out of the bag. Let me explain: it was a birthday celebration and we had preordered dessert and were specific with our instructions on who the birthday person was. The waitress went straight to the birthday person and declared that dessert had already been ordered so the surprise was ruined. She did apologise and we are not big on surprises.

The salad with avocado, blue cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette was extremely refreshing. Hardly anything beats a great, perfectly cooked and flavorful steak but when you get served French purple grape mustard with it, you're in heaven. The service has made my experience finally a remarkable one....very friendly, efficient and experienced. The only point that needs improvement is the light in the back area of the restaurant, it is a touch too dark. Would definitely return.",5-May,Excellent,No,,
CUT,May,Week 19,Saturday,7/5/2016,"""Soggy steak. Robotic service.""","I was disappointed with the food. I wanted the edges of the steak to have some crispiness on the fat, but it was soggy. I expected to beef to have a rich complex flavor like Morton's, but it just tasted like a regular piece of meat. The flavor combinations of the recipes were very traditional/predictable, which is good, but it meant that the celebrity chef's creativity couldn't rescue the poor execution. The table wasn't leveled on the floor and kept rocking when somebody would lean on the table. We arrived very hungry when the restaurant opened, but the servers were so oriented toward getting lots of tables started that they paid no attention to the tables they already had. We wanted to get drinks and order appetizers quickly, but we couldn't get any service beyond menus and water for more than 20 minutes of our stay. It was surreal to be raising our hands and signaling for service while a dozen servers scurried around the room without looking. Overall the servers were extremely polite, to the point of being obsequious, but they didn't actually DO anything besides brown-nose and follow a robotic routine. They came at certain intervals to check on us and to refill water, but unfortunately those appearances turned out to be exactly the opposite of when we needed a server. When our glasses were empty, nobody came. We signaled, nobody saw us. When we were deep in an important conversation, they interrupted us to give a speech about beef cuts. The staff give memorized speeches about the food, but when we asked questions, it was clear they didn't know anything that wasn't in the speech.",1-May,Terrible,No,,

Sky on 57,May,Week 19,Saturday,7/5/2016,"""Fantastic Views with Great Food""","Having taken our Australian friends out to a variety of places around Singapore, they wanted to return the favour in the hotel they were staying - Marina Bay Sands. They visited Singapore for three and a half days and we worked out that Saturday lunch was the best time for us all to go out. After considerable discussion about which venue to choose, Sky on 57 was chosen because of the ability to enjoy air con while having lunch but being able to take in the view after lunch on top of MBS. We arrived at around 12.45 and started things off with a drink at Ce La Vie. The option of air con was justified as the drink outside, while lovely, was pretty hot. Once we finished our drink and taken in the views of the City we moved to the restaurant. For reasons only known to the venue (they only let people staying in the hotel access the entire 57th floor - our friends had checked out so didn't have their access cards, probably because of crowds of people trying to get into the Infinity Pool), we had to go down to the ground floor in tower 3 walk through the atrium to tower 1 and back up the elevator to the restaurant. Not a big problem, in fact it's definitely a first world problem, but worth mentioning. Once in the restaurant, the feeling of light and space encapsulated us despite the restaurant being 80% full. We decided to go for the Business Luncheon option where you get a number of options for Starter, Soup, Main Course and Dessert. Ironically, the ladies went for three courses, they didn't have the soup and the men went for four courses. The ladies each ordered the same and the men likewise. I enjoyed JQ's Signature Starter, a Foie Gras Ziao Long Bao - it was sensational. It consisted of 5 dumplings and both wives enjoyed one as the men were exclaiming how delicious they were. For the soup course, I had Jerusalem Artichoke Veloute containing a blue swimmer crab - again, it was delicious. For main I selected the Maori Lakes Lamb Rack which came with tasty spices, chickpea stew and tamarind jus. This was very nice but if one ranked it with the first two dishes, it would be slightly below. For desert I had the Reconstructed Black Forest. Again, this was nice, a little small perhaps but the ladies had ""Paris-Brest"", a hazelnut cream, chocolate disc with lulo sorbet. This time the men got a taste and we agreed, this was nicer that what we had. The surprising thing about our lunch was the cost. I would have expected it to be at least $100 per head given the venue but with three courses costing $55 and four being $65, it is great value. Be warned, men have to wear long pants and closed shoes but given its in air conditioned comfort, this isn't an issue. Also, the air con is not too cold which is something we've found in some other places. After lunch, which was around 4 pm, we strolled out onto the deck and took in the views of the City and East Coast. The views were amazing and all in all, it was a perfect afternoon. I should also mention the coffee - I am pretty particular about my coffee and ordered my usual picollo latte. What was provided was very good and on par with most of what I enjoyed back in Australia.",5-May,Excellent,No,,

This is well priced and there are a range of options. One of our orders was poached eggs on avocado with toast (homemade pumpernickel bread). Delicious and very nicely presented. They were also very helpful in doing an yummy side salad. Sadly, our other order, the Full English Breakfast was disappointing and it didn't feel like it was off the same menu. The poached eggs, sausage, bacon, tomato and mushroom were all cooked perfectly. However, the tinned baked beans and sliced white factory made bread let this meal down. It wouldn't have taken much to elevate this dish to what we would have expected from a Gordon Ramsay establishment. In our opinion, all it needed was some good quality bread (such as the pumpernickel, a sourdough or something more rustic) and maybe some homemade baked beans (check out the homemade baked beans at Common Man Coffee Roasters - a great breakfast spot in Singapore). Not drastic changes but something to make this breakfast a little less ordinary and be closer to the competition. Also worth noting is that the coffee was average. Room for improvement!

I also requested for a table with a view when I rang up to book to which the person over the line replied they will try but there is no guarantee. Glad that they did take note and ushered us to a lovely table with a view of the bay. The place was enchantingly dark and tastefully decorated. We ordered the scallops and asparagus as starters. For mains, I went for the cod and my hubby caved in and went for the lamb shank promotion which came with a bottle of Spanish wine. The basket of bread came before the dishes and I must say everything tasted wonderful and fresh. The wine was a good recommendation too. For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant and the banana toffee pudding. Both melted into our mouths. Service was fast and not overbearing. The only thing which I would like to quibble on would be having to put my handbag on the floor. The chair as a hole in at the back and the bag will fall if you are not careful. If you are not planning to change the chair, perhaps get a small basket under the table where ladies can put their belongings safely without worrying. In addition, although there was supposed to be a complimentary parking if you spend above $150, alas we did not get to enjoy that privilege. Nowadays, am sure most would agree that a night out in Singapore is easily that amount or more :-) What happened to us was that we were issued the the complimentary parking ticket by the restaurant but the ticket did not work on the way out. After numerous times of trying to scan the coupon, we gave up as the queue in the car park to get out was building up. Hence, the coupon was of no use to us and we still had to use our cash card to pay for the parking fee. It is a no-no to give your customers expired parking coupons or coupons that don't work. It is likened to an empty promise or a useless benefit. That aside, we would most definitely come back again as we rather enjoy the romantic ambience with its dim lighting and gorgeous view. The food ain't bad too but I hope that they do something about the parking coupons issue which I have just highlighted and also as an added service, the possibility of allowing lady customers to put their bag safely in a clean basket underneath the table.",4-May,Very Good,No,,

We booked last minute for a mid-week parent-escape date night for dinner before seeing UB40 at the Grand Theatre at Marina Bay Sands. When they learned we were seeing a show they speeded up service and kept track of time on our behalf. Cocktails were bespoke & house made. Complimentary apps were sent to our table and both mains brought together, which is a rarity in Singapore. Staff was overly hovering. I felt like our table was tended over by a hive of bees. To be fair, the interactive dining experience began when we asked our waiter a few questions about cocktails bringing the bar tender over, which then carried on through the meal which was delicious, well seasoned & portioned, and delivered by multiple servers. At the end, when yet another person arrived to ask how our meal was I asked, (mildly exasperated) ""And who are you?"" Turns out it was chef/owner David Meyers who has a Michelin star at his first restaurant in LA and several other award winning places around the world. He was super-cool and friendly and just happened to be in town checking on his place. And suddenly, just like that, rather than being in the lobby of MBS, we are transported to a village cafe where the chef pulls up a chair and you laugh like old friends.

This place has more of an 'adults only' vibe. We ordered two pizzas to share: burrata and slow-roasted tomatoes, and prosciutto di parma with rucola and mozarella. Burrata one has great balance of flavors, very tasty. Prosciutto was okay, I've had better of this variety in Singapore. Mozarella was absent from what I could see and the prosciutto was oily. Pizza dough is great, tomato base lovely, al forno baking perfect. We had the house special for Tuesdays which is crispy duck leg with lentils. The lentils steal the show: lovely texture and flavors. The duck leg was okay. For drinks I recommend the house made ice teas, which we had along with some rose. We spent about $160 for all this. Service was adequate if a bit too attentive and rushed.

When you make a reservation they make it clear that if you are not on time they will only hold the reservation for 15mins. I have no problem with this, however we actually arrived 10mins early and the receptionist seemed completely lost by this. Our table was not ready and there was no space at the bar for us so sit and have a drink so we all left standing in the doorway light lost sheep. They eventually found us a space at the bar so we proceeded order some drinks. My drink and my wife's arrived after a few minutes but our friends did not. I noticed the barman serving us laughing and chatting to two girls sitting just along the bar for us. After several attempts to get his attention with no success my friend walked over to him and asked about his drinks. The barman apologised and said he had forgotten. So he forgot a simple 4 drink order and seem far more interested in chatting up the two girls at the bar, we were not very impressed. Our table was finally ready 10 minutes after the reservation time and we were shown to it. Our server arrived handed us the menus, mutter something completely unintelligible and duly disappeared. We did not see him again for another 10 minutes. When he did return I asked him if we could have some of the bread that they normally provide and it arrived 5 minutes later. He then appeared back after another 5 minutes to take our order. So it took 20 minutes from siting down to having our order. Not impressed again. When our main courses arrived from the kitchen they we placed on a serving stool near our table but under an aircon unit. They sat there for about 3min until I shouted on our server and asked him to serve them, as he had clear not noticed they were there, despite standing a few feet from them. So by the time they served they were luke warm. We just ate them, as it was not worth the hassle of returning them to wait for replacements. My friend made the comment that the server must be working his notice, which about summed it up perfectly. The food as always was excellent and I just can fault it. That was the only plus point to the evening hence the two stars. When we asked for the bill one of the senior front of house staff came over to our table to ask if everything had been ok and we told here that the service had been extremely poor. She did not seem overly concerned, made a half baked insincere apology and duly walked away. As we left the restaurant she looked over to me and drew me a dirty look. I just shook my head and walked out. The chefs and kitchen staff clearly take great pride in the food being served, however they are being seriously let down by the very poor service and attitude by the front of house staff. A very disappointing experience for our friends who had very much look forward to dining there. They will never go back. WilI I go back?

They made recommendations for our order to ensure we didn't over order and enjoyed a good selection of entrees, mains and desserts. This to me is a mark of great service and something many fine dining establishments in Singapore should learn from. Some highlights that we really enjoyed - the veal ragout and foie gras kaya toast were delicious. grilled lamb chops (very fresh and not gamey), steak and cod were all very tasty. Dessert's must orders would be the famous salted caramel souffle and the chocolate espresso semifreddo (this made all of our eyes light up).

Moving on..I wasn't greeted to start with, asked for a table at the bar and was escorted to my seating choice. Bar Staff, especially one, i believe he was from Penang, Malaysia.

I have stayed at various 5 and 7 Star hotels around the world as my job requires travelling not mention working at several Top end Restaurants and Hotels in Toronto. I put on my academic hat and noticed the following: Cling wrap still attached to where the wine glasses are kept, A bartender who cut mini ice blocks, dropped one block in the sink and then put it into a drink he was preparing for a customer (Lucky not mine), Uncleared glasses (Used), Tables left uncleared (Staff walking past it and not clearing),Arrogant staff except for a select 3, You have to ask if you want something although the restaurant has an abundance of staff compared to seating capacity (Quite genius if you look at it from a marketing prospective), Slow service. Time for the bill, Drinks are pretty reasonable for the caliber of venue (Have spent more at less established venues). Overall, Spago (Lounge) has a classy ambiance but lacks professionalism due to staff.. The hostess's (except for 2 hostess's) had a valley kinda persona and lack courtesy (Don't smile or acknowledge patrons).

On arrival there was some confusion with our booking and [then] our table was not ready. This wasn?t handled too well and we were ushered to the bar area which is quite small and it was awkward; seven of us standing around waiting (note we were precisely on time and the restaurant was not super busy?). Once seated there was a delay in getting service in terms of a drink order being taken which ended up being given along with the food order. Compared to our many previous visits the service just wasn?t up to the ?normal? standards BSK themselves have set. All meals arrived together, which is great, and very quickly turned out. However that speed came at a cost in that two hamburgers had to be sent back as they were undercooked. The orders were for ?well done? and ?medium? and my guests were none too happy with burgers that were externally seared but raw, cold and bloody in the middle. Worth noting that it was not a case of the order being served on the ?rare? side of well done or medium these were undercooked which purely a case of lack of attention to detail. As my guests pointed out for a hamburger costing $28 you?d expect it to be cooked to order and also ?just how hard is it to cook a burger?? Profuse apologies and new burgers were cooked correctly to order arriving about 15mins later. Unfortunately this did disrupt the gathering and after the fifth ?mechanical? apology from a swam of ever increasingly senior staff it started to wear a little thin. It?s a shame when past experience gives you confidence to take a larger group only to have those expectations [literally] undercooked! Hoping this feedback will help BSK keep focus on the basics of service and attention to detail which I have to say on all previous visits has been outstanding.",3-May,Average,No,,

We asked medium rare and it came out as medium to medium well. We returned the dish. After 20 min of waiting without main meal, the steak comes back. Still medium but decided to eat it anyway.

Nonetheless I wanted to go there with my toddler (knowing that if all else fails, he'd eat chips). We arrived without a booking, but since it's only 6:30 I thought we could try our luck. It worked out, I got a nice table that is booked for 7:30, but the lady assured me the service is fast. It was, and I was glad, my son was not done finishing up the crunchy paper-thin crisps and bread that was served before our food arrived. I ordered the 28 dollar burger, which was very reasonably priced. I asked to change the side of chips to onion rings. The burger did not come with much condiments, which means the meat needs to be absolutely delicious. It wasn't. The onion rings were a tad too greasy. After my meal, I felt like my insides were doused in oil and started to feel a bit sick. Even my son, who is normally crazy about chips, didn't eat much of it. On the upside, the restaurant is quite kid friendly. My son had fish and chips and it was $14 only, and we ordered kids' menu banana toffee pudding with ice cream for $8. My total bill was $58, only because I didn't order a drink (and thank god they serve ice water) because drink prices were ridiculous. A glass of wine is at least 20 dollars, and soda and other drinks were more than $10. My son did get to bring home a small memento - coloring books and pencils which was quite nice. I also got some cookies after I paid the bill. I don't mind coming back to try other stuff in the menu, I hope it will be a more pleasant experience.

Admittedly, the food isn't bad, it is competently executed, but lacks character. Perhaps their effort is reserved for dinner, but I am unable to judge that. Their lunch, however, gave the impression of a chain restaurant with good quality control. My more recent meal was less colored by the atmosphere, partially because the restaurant is much more crowded than it had been when it first opened and they now, for some reason, have decided to ruin the mood with overly loud pop music.

It was not deep-fried like how it is served in many places. However, its portion was a little meagre, in my opinion. The chicken wings was cooked with just the right amount of spices and interestingly presented with strips of pandan leaves. My personal favourite was the spinach salad sprinkled with ricotta cheese.

We were lucky enough to score an outside table with views over Marina Bay, I can't complain under the circumstances. This was the smoking area but after a drunk woman decided to complain loudly and leave after lighting a cigarette blowing smoke all over our table, we were able to shuffle upwind so this wouldn't happen again. We were both very happy with that. The menu was never going to be cheap, that's ok given the location and Gordon Ramsay naming of the restaurant. The question is, does the eatery live up to the hype? The menu was simple as espoused on many of Ramsay's hit television shows, a simple menu with just a handful of options done right. The wine list was expensive and we chose a Spanish and Portuguese red to wash down our lamb and duck meals. For me, I wasn't impressed with the duck but as I have never really been a huge fan of duck, that probably wasn't unusual and at any rate, it was my partner's meal and not mine. I ordered lamb and while the shanks were out of stock that night, the lamb substitution lived up to expectations. What didn't live up to expectations was the vegetables ordered on the side, we were asked to order side dishes and we ordered exactly what came on our dishes. We don't know the menu and rely on the waiters to advise us, this was an expensive and unnecessary addition that really soured the evening, nobody likes being taken for a ride. Having been involved in hospitality and tourism, I understand what is involved in upselling and maybe we looked like tourists who would only ever visit once. However, in these days of social media, you can't risk that attitude anymore. Would I visit again?

Also the hostesses tend to seat too many parties side by side at the bar so much that it felt constraining & cramped. This hiccup aside, I had a good meal during my visit to Spago. For starters I had their signature tuna tartare cones which were just the right amount of sweet & salty. Bread service was lovely too with an assortment of house baked breads & two kinds of butter. I selected the New York sirloin & asked for it to be done medium rare. Although the steak had a nice char on it, it was cooked a bit too long & thus came out medium well. There was a nice accompanying side of potato gratin as well as a lovely thick gravy, full of sticky beefy flavours to pour over the dish. Chargrilled brussels sprouts were a nice accompaniment.

Dessert was an apple crumble with vanilla custard. And the after lunch coffee was excellent, served with complimentary cookies. Little touches that made the meal special: knowing that it was my friend's birthday (I indicated that it was a special occasion during the booking online), the restaurant offered to put a candle on his pudding when they called to confirm my reservation. When our dessert arrived, there was no candle on the apple crumble. I was disappointed. But lo and behold, the staff came over with a little brownie and lighted candle singing 'Happy Birthday'!

He and the entire team made us feel so welcomed and the cocktails were down right extraordinary, (best Singapore sling, sorry Raffles) that we had to stay for dinner. Definitely one of the best dinners we have had in Singapore. The pork neck and Kagoshima steak were top notch. We also loved the chilled crab dish, carpaccio and the beautiful lobster tail!

First I'm not a fan of restaurants thinking it is OK to charge for your Steak and not bother to give you sides. I mean really how much to vegetables cost that you cant put them on the plate, instead you have to pay $20-30 each for some potatoes. Apart from that I was excited to eat the steak. I ordered my steak 9it was the porterhouse (for 2). I think it was $200 from memory. It takes at least forty minutes (I eat it rare so that was quite a wait), then when it comes they brought the wrong steak. They brought a bone in Rib Fillet. I said 'that's not what I ordered"" and the waiter said yes you did. I reiterated. He then checked his little piece paper (yes he used a piece of paper in 5 star restaurant but I digress) and realised he had made an error. He stands and looks at me. I look back with a questioning look on my face but say nothing. he then says, ""well do you want it"". Ummm let me think $200 for a steak that I didn't order hows about NO. So he petulantly takes it back and then ANOTHER half an hour later the steak I actually ordered comes out. I am trying to be objective in my assessment of the steak (as you can imagine my experience had been somewhat soured at this point) but to be honest it wasn't brilliant. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty nice but I wanted it to blow me away and it just didn't. the cut was nice, it was cooked perfectly, it was presented really well and the flavour was pretty good but I have significantly better for much less.

THe place is not crowded, because of the open space. Service from waiters / manager A+. The price is extremely reasonable at 88$. The only downside was the 70$ supplement if you choose to have free flow alcohol which I find to be way overpriced. Thus we didnt opt for that.

I was really looking forward to this restaurant and the reservations person whom I liaised with on email was quite efficient and friendly. They offered me to book a set menu and the cellar, but I wanted the a little of the bay view as well as to give my family meal options as we all have different tastes. So we settled on a semi-restricted dinner menu which still had loads of variety. The service at the restaurant was great, but I did unfortunately have high expectations for the food. All 9 adults felt that they the food was not flavoursome enough and while good, it just did not meet our expectation of a Gordon Ramsay dinner.

You will never find a dessert like this anywhere and it's something which makes an impression on both the mind and palate. There were sauce options on the menu but please don't add or use any sauce on your steak, it's seasoned perfectly you do not even need to reach for the salt. The flavour of the meat itself is so good on its own. There are interesting variety of sauces but resist the urge. Ordered the usual 2 cocktails shiso and lavender. Both were good but not as amazing as the past 2 visits, kind of lacked the usual depth in flavour. The shiso honey one had too intense shiso flavour it tasted almost like a mojito as though it had lots of mint leaves. The lavender one did not taste anything like the one i had the past 2 times but it's still palatable. The best place for steak, cream spinach & impecable service.",5-May,Excellent,No,,

Spago,July,Week 31,Thursday,28/7/2016,"""Californian with a Singapore twist""","Spago is Wolfgang Puck's second venture in Singapore (after the Steakhouse called CUT that is also located at Marina Bay Sands). Just like CUT, the early days of its operations are very promising. The Spago brand is supposed to be the flagship of Puck's impressive restaurant empire with the ""mothership"" being based in Beverly Hills. The location is certainly hard to beat although your journey to Spago will be via multiple lifts at MBS, forcing you to change along your way up. The reward upon arrival is a great view and a cozy but fresh ambiance that fits very well to the Californian culinary theme. The venue: Tables are spaced appropriately, however, a word of caution - if you are seated near the entrance you will experience Singapore's humid climate every time somebody opens the main door. The Food: Spago's friendly and competent service team will swing instantly into action upon being seated and food as well as beverage menus are a delight. The Californian cuisine receives some ""Singapore twists"" recommendations include ""kaya toast"" as well as ""Laksa"". The kaya toast option is a great starter but one can also indulge in fresh tuna tartar or grilled octopus salad. For mains, a nice selection of seafood dishes and meats are available. Our table opted heavily towards seafood and the cod options did not disappoint. The veal chop was another fantastic choice but we sadly missed out on the lamb (only so many dishes one can sample...). The sides are truly remarkable and you'll rediscover your love for vegetables again! But leave enough space for dessert.The Caramel sea salt souffle was the favorite of the table but the frozen nougat also disappeared seemingly fast. The Beverages: Spago has some stunning wines available including hard to get labels and those will complement your dinner experience perfectly. The Service: The service crew looking after us performed very well. Constant refill of beverages, well timed delivery of meals and clearing of plates, combined with a relaxed approach and humor made the evening very enjoyable. The Music: The only serious negative was the the volume level of the background music that was ""not so background"". Three times we asked to lower it and succeeded finally and were able to have a proper conversation without raising our voices. Summary: Spago is well worth a visit - as a matter of fact it may be one of top venues in Singapore at this point and time.

They were all good but portion sizes are way too big. The Wagyu beef wasn't too big but it's too rich that by the time you get through it, it's a bit too much. I think it was 170 grams which costs SGD320++ so not finishing it wasn't an option. Wine is super expensive. A glass of brut champagne is SGD40++ and SGD60++ for rose champagne. Service is good.

Dont get me wrong, Spago continues to have great food and I dont mind making my way through the minefield on the ground level of MBS--passing all the tourists in beach wear and robes from the pool to get to the restaurant. There were two things that have changed. First of all the prices have gone up. Its understandable you open with reasonable prices then put everything up when you get the clientele. I still don't mind paying because the food is always good. But the one thing that really annoys me now is the service. It has changed a lot from my first visit. The service is now what I call 'at will' service, which means they will come when you call them. There are a lot of people around and someone is always close by. But why do you need to call someone for drinks? Or a beer glass when the beer comes with no glass for your lady? Or when you want to order something? On my first visit it was much more proactive, there was always a smile and a question 'can I get you anything?' but not this time. And the final straw was when I paid with my AMEX credit card, a thick accent from abroad comes running back with my card and says quote unquote 'your card no good, you have another one?'

We were alright with that and were seated where we could see the chefs preparing the appetisers :) We wanted to eat at Osteria Mozza a few weeks before but were told that there were no tables (and they didn't offer us the bar seats so I'm guessing that they were really full). We ordered the chef's tasting menu (note that everyone at the table has to order the tasting menu as well, but everyone can choose one dish out of the two options provided for each course). The wait staff were very patient and explained each dish to us and gave recommendations when asked. The serving portions aren't too big, and the food is really good.

The staff was very accommodating and sat us at the bar, overlooking Marina Bay area. This was perfect as we were just there for some drinks and appetizers. It was a good first experience and I vowed to come back to try the food. Cut to several months later and my partner and I were in Shoppes at Marina Bay. Decided on the spur of the moment to try and see if we could have lunch here. On a weekend. The gods must have been smiling because we were seated straight away. We ordered the Dingly Dell Pork Belly as recommended by our waiter and it was great! The beers we had with it went well with the food, too! Third and fourth time we went, we still didn't make a reservation but were sat in the bar for both occasions, which we didn't really mind, as it was great to sit side by side and people watch while being able to converse. This being Singapore, there are many other great places to have fabulous food and this restaurant is one of them. The food is anchored by British cuisine ? I guess, not surprising since it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant ? and the food is very very good. Since the first time we've come, we've tried the pork belly, the burgers, the fish and chips and the steak and ale pie (this was delicious, btw! The crust was flaky and light and the gravy and filling were delectable). All were topnotch. My partner, who is British, says that the fish and chips is the best he's had in Singapore. Aside from the food, the service is exemplary. Staff are very well trained, and would come over to the table to inquire how the meal was. The wait for the food was also not that long, considering they get full up on the weekends. Note though, that this is an expensive place to eat at. Not sticker-shock expensive, no. But still, be prepared to fork over around $100-120 for two people for a meal. Still, for a once-in-a-while splurge, it's pretty good!",5-May,Excellent,Yes,20/8/2016,10

My fiance and I were very excited when we heard Gordon Ramsay was going to open a restaurant in Singapore, we are his fans watching his cooking videos almost daily and this news became a reality to us. Due to his renowned popularity and the intended fine dining establishment, we were expecting to pay a bomb just to get to taste Gordon Ramsay food. But No! The price is definitely reasonable and affordable. Its website is very detailed with food menu and pricing and we could make direct online reservation with special request note on celebrating our 2nd anniversary. On arrival date, we were greeted professionally, guided to our seats, food were served and cleared quickly; overall service was great. It was a fine-dining atmosphere and there is an alfresco bar area could look out to Marina Bay waters. The food were in big portions, nicely done up and decorated. The taste was towards alittle salty but everything was awesome, Chef was able to deliver Gordon Ramsay standard. Every staff was attentive, professional and seen happy working here. We were very impressed of the dining experience. Before we ended the night, Bread Street Kitchen surprised us with a complimentary piece of anniversary cake with ice cream and wished us a Happy anniversary. We felt like royalties in this awesome dining venue. Our only concern was we wondered why a glass of wine could be priced around the same as the cheapest food item in the menu. Personally, we graded Bread Street Kitchen a definite 6-star dining restaurant to visit. I shall return for my fiance birthday soon.",5-May,Excellent,Yes,20/8/2016,9

For me personally as a service provider, I have always felt that I have failed my job if a guests has to rise their hands to call for me moreover many guests raising their hands and looking around for service.

Chicken liver and foie gras parfait with Earl Grey jelly is nice but not a wow experience. For the main course I ordered beef wellington to share.

Booking a month ahead for this round naturally raised the expectation to very high. I had a great family day at adventure cove so lots of room for great food. We have the long table right next to bar and the entrance. The setting and view are great. Exciting music and smart arrangement. The today's special is a pork t-bone and it wasn't that fantastic. Steak and ale pie is delicious. Red cabbage salad was ok but orange sauce can ruin the taste when it is not chilled. The apple pie was good in terms of right level of sweetness and a great crusty texture. Taste of Mantorla was an interesting dessert drink that I would probably miss. Overall it would have been four stars but I decided not to. This long awaited experience was more or less ruined by the server tonight. The female server probably works hard but absolutely lack of training and EQ. The last thing you want during the course of taking order is to make your customers feel stupid. She has successfully achieved that by responding to the question of ""what is your recommendation"" with a sigh, turning away to smirk and with a remark of ""it is your own personal preference"". Later on she came back to ask for the regular 15 mins check and was fumbling when we commented on how fat the pork t-bone was. She was not able to explain or to the feedback to anyone. I have to say I generally make friends with the servers and chefs like in other reports. But this has completely spoiled my night.",2-May,Poor,Yes,20/8/2016,7

Service is very professional and reminds me of those premium restaurants in the US. They could be a little more genuine, though. Otherwise, it will all feel so pretentious. CUT's setting is rather dark, very modern --- it feels a lot like dinner clubs in NYC. All in all, nice place to hang-out after work with friends or colleagues. Kids or family? Maybe not so. We ordered bigeye tuna tartare and the Alaskan King Crab and Shrimp Louis as appetizers. Both are nicely cooked, but my preference is the Louis because of the spicy tomato-horseradish sauce. My main course is the 100% Wagyu Hokkaido Snow Beef filet mignon. Taste very nice, and luckily I ordered the filet mignon which is only 120g. Too big portion of wagyu/kobe/matsuzaka beef usually make you feel stuffy very quickly. Smaller size means just nice. Too excited to eat this until I forgot to take picture of the beef! Net, this is a good place to go for premium beef if you don't care about the price. Price is rather steep --- $250 for the beef and $22-41 for each appetizer dish, before GST and service charge.

Entree of choice were hand made brandy snaps formed into cones containing fish and wonderful seasoned meat. Steak tartare was on offer and was delicious. Roast duck was succulent and cooked to perfection crispy on the outside pink on the inside. Angry lobster screamed try me and did not disappoint. Spicy whole maine lobster was presented in the shell and the waiter requested permission to prepare the lobster and expertly removed the tender meat from the shell. The performance enchancing the occassion. Finish with two cheeses choosen from an impressive cheese board they we tasty and quality. Just to be different souffle was the dessert I chose. Our waiter advised that the chef had rejected the souffle that had been prepared and would make a new souffle and this would take about 20 minutes. No problem on holiday glass of wine in hand and a million dollar view the time flew by.

Thinking back I can not fault any and everything was really good. Service was great although would have been great if a tad faster, but that was maybe because we were in a bit of a rush.

Maybe if that is the case, we would be dining outside and enjoying the view. Today we are having the 3-course restaurant week lunch which costs $40++ per person. We start the meal with the bread basket, served with butter. There are 4 types of bread : cheese, Japanese, baguette and herb. The baguette has quite a hard crust. The cheese one is most yummy to have. The bread is refillable. Starter : Kurobuta Wanton Sauteed prawns, lobster & tomato fondue The overpacked wantons look more like siew mai with filling threatening to come out. It tastes quite flavourful and juicy. Main Course : Sakura Chicken Sauteed mushroom, potato mousseline, Shao Xing wine sauce The dish is fragrant and reminds me of the Herbal Emperor Chicken ????? with its smell. Although served with cream sauce, the sauce is light with asian flavours in it. The chicken is very tender and tears easily from the bone. We also order the resturant's signature JQ's Signature Foie Gras Xiao Long Bao ????? ($25++). The xiao long bao has quite an amount of soup inside. It has the strong flavour of foie gras and truffle in it too. But I feel that the skin of the xiao long bao is a bit too thick. The staff has replied that such thick skin is needed in order to hold the soup. Dessert : JQ's Signature Freshly baked fine apple tart, vanilla ice cream Unlike that the usual apple tart, the thinly sliced apple lies on a thin crispy pastry skin. I like the flakiness of the tart, which is balanced by the ice cream. I am a bit sad that the ice cream melts rather fast, which makes one feels the need to rush through the dish.

We shared three starters, the tuna cones, veal tarter and octopus. All three were so different and so excellent and unique. I then had the halibut laksa which was laksa, but so much more. I love laksa and the way it was done with a small amount of broth, noodles and delicious fish was a first and I will have to try again.

This bowl of laksa was generously big portion with 2 huge prawns. Yup. 2 prawns. Huge prawns swimming inside. Absolutely fabulous. Only some slight problems. Firstly, the table height was not good. Too low. So imagine flipping up the laksa rice noodles a great height while the 57 floor breeze was blowing... laksa gravy splurts and stains clothes. Next problem... it was described as a warning... Spicy. Well, let's just say that for local Singaporean taste, this was far from spicy. But hey all is forgiven. The views from the top was superb and I will surely come back again for a $12++ laksa.

Apart from that i ordered from the set menu, salmon tartare and pasta with mushrooms and POACHED EGG... Felt quite disappointed to be honest... I love salmon tartare and this time, i would say that with all these spices added to the salmon i could not even have the taste of the salmon. The pasta was good, but when it came, i broke through the poached egg, and all i wanted is to see that yolk flowing onto the pasta, but disappointed again it was more of a boiled egg. The pasta had way too much mushroom and sauce thus making it too much and could not even finish... Service was good, attentive but needs more reaction and initiative from waiters, for example without me saying or making them notice, they saw the egg was not poached, they should have excused themselves and take it back to the kitchen to do it again...

The day before our dinner, a staff called to confirm our reservation and asked if we were celebrating a birthday. My family member replied that we are celebrating a wedding anniversary. We had requested for seats by the window on the first level. However we were told that window seats were not available for four people, and we were shown to our table with couch seats. For starters, we had the tamarind spiced chicken wings. For our mains, we ordered the fish and chips, the Dingley Dell pork belly and the beef burger. While waiting for our food to be served, complimentary bread sticks, bread and crackers were served. The tamarind spiced chicken wings are not spicy at all, and it is really flavourful. The pork belly is lean with crispy crackling and it is delicious. It is good to share as no doubt it is tasty, you feel 'sick' so it's good to share the calories. The fish and chips is crispy on the outside and big chunks of tasty fish on the inside. All the mains were served with thick cut potatoes. While waiting for the check, we were pleasantly surprised when a dessert was served, with the word 'happy anniversary' inscribed on the plate. There are complimentary cookies at the end of the meal. It is really tasty and I wonder if they sell them. The staff helped to take photos for us. Service is good and the staffs are friendly. The view of the waterfront on the outside is a bonus.

The cold dish sector contains prawn, oysters, mussels and crab. Not fantastic. Just normal for a five star hotel. A lot of different salad like octopus, tabbouleh, rojak, mushroom truffles with cheese but all of them tasted bland. A bit unique is the honeycomb which drips on strings to the plate underneath it which contains a lot of different nuts to go with. 6 or 7 varieties of cheese to choose from. There is also the Indian corner. Fish and chip is ok. It is served in a leaf platter shaped like a boat. Ice-creams are all sorbet type & a bit sour. Of all the food there, only the desserts are the best. The bread pudding is yummy with creamy vanilla sauce and so is the cream brulee. Different varieties of chocolates. Tasty almond with longan. There's also chin chow mixed with soya bean. Overall, I find that the cost for dinner in this restaurant is on the high side where the food is not that great. Even some 3 or 4 star restaurant can provide better food than here. To park here one must use valet parking. If not, carpark is very far away on the North sector.

The cocktail lost is very Wolfgang Puck and all the drinks fantastic. The food was mixed - spring rolls and hamachi good, sushi and fries have had better. The service was friendly but incredibly slow and inattentive. Our drinks took 30 mins plus to arrive and required a bit of follow up. Felt I was always flagging down a waitress rather than being attended to. This place is expensive ie over SGD 400 for five cocktails and about 5 dishes off the snack menu, but worth every dollar for the view and atmosphere. Move over Ce La Vi...",4-May,Very Good,No,,

That is polite code for, ""not great, just mediocre"". I was lucky enough to have had my meal paid by work as our group lunched here after a meeting. So I'm not going to complain about how much it was... I will say that it is a pricey place (befitting the location really in the Marina Bay Sands mall), and for the price, the food is only just about OK. Nothing stand out, just regular bistro stuff, and not brilliantly executed. It was so forgettable, I can't even remember what I had. So...if you're after something mind blowing, this isn't the place for you.",3-May,Average,No,,
Pizzeria Mozza,September,Week 40,Friday,30/9/2016,"""Good pizzas in a nice ambience""","With a cosy interior and friendly staff, this is a one of the few places in town serving good pizzas fresh from the wood fired ovens. Their starters are just as good and so is their drinks menu. Reservations are recommended as they are almost always full and being closest to the Sands a Theatre, a popular choice for pre-show meals too. It can be a little noisy with the crowds and close table arrangement but the dim lighting and good selection of songs on their playlist makes the meals very enjoyable.",4-May,Very Good,No,,
Spago,September,Week 40,Friday,30/9/2016,"""Beautiful view. Great food. ""","Spago is located on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Tower overlooking the infinity pool in the sky and the beautiful Singapore city scape. The food and service are world class. It's not an inexpensive restaurant but the service is so good it takes a bit of the shock out of the price. You can arrive early for cocktails al fresco. The view is great but the music is loud and makes intimate conversation impossible. The seating, while comfortable, is not conducive to good conversation either. Although you are only steps away from the incredible infinity pool (one of the best and most unique in the world), you may not enter the pool or walk on the pool deck without a pass as a guest of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The only unpleasant part of Spago is the first floor level entrance and chaos of the MBS Hotel. But once you reach the 57th floor it's worth it. Our meal was delicious, presented well by knowledgeable and friendly staff. The cocktails very very well made and the wine list is extensive. I am already planning my next trip back with visiting guests. If it's in your budget, don't miss it.",5-May,Excellent,No,,

The waitstaff are so busy there's no personal service whatsoever, our waitress was friendly enough but to be honest we just felt sorry for her. We decided not to try the desserts because we couldn't wait to get out of there! Very very expensive and all your paying for is the name, we came out and went and got a burger and fries from a lovely little restaurant because we was all so hungry! My stomach churns every time I think about the food especially the chicken it hadn't been gutted properly and there was red stringy veins through it!!

Customer service is TERRIBLE, both from the staff here and even the manager!!! It's by far the WORST customer service i've gotten in my entire life. They wouldn't even admit their mistake for deceiving their customers, and even if you were to talk to the manager about an issue you're facing, he will never give in or even bother to apologize!!! Customers to them are always wrong and to them, they just want to earn their money. Food was only okay, but a complete rip off. No point coming here and spending your money on ok food and a terrible customer service. You could better spend your money elsewhere. Rest assured I will never be back at this restaurant for the rest of my life. And I won't ever recommend this place to anyone even if it was our last option.",1-May,Terrible,No,,

Positive: - the staff was excellent there. Thank you! - Environment and location was Perfect! - Prices are reasonable - the mashed potato came with the steak was good. steak was good (not great) - the chocolate fondant was excellent! - the starter crab tagliolini was good. Negative: -my cod fish was ""OK"". nothing to shout about, they grilled it right for the meat and skin yet the sauce wasn't that good to matched with the fish. it does taste a bit of ABC Brand dark sauce from indonesia. the crushed potatoes was tasteless. well i could get that kind of quality everywhere! -Food presentations was ""lazy-work"". sorry gordon, it's just average even i got the idea as ""Casual dining"" ... -the Complimentary Bread was just Ok. it was warm but again...average. -3-in-1 dessert as for the ice-creams was terrible. we felt like it was taken out from 7-eleven cooler. -Spoon and Fork was placed directly on the table directly without any clothes and napkin on it where i need to consider the hygiene ... and in the wrong direction.

The quality of the ingredients, the presentation and of course the taste of the meal was impeccable. Having visited several times, I can say with confidence that their quality and experience is always consistent - excellent. Of course you pay for this and I have heard it said around Singapore that it is ""overpriced"". I disagree. I am willing to pay for the consistency and quality. We had starters (the pork belly with julienned apple on top is really special). The mussels were very fresh and plentiful and everyone at the table (8 of us) were impressed by them. Main course was a selection of wagyu as well as a couple tomahawks along with multiple side dishes. The japanese wagyu was the consensus favorite and the macaroni and cheese side didn't last long. Another fantastic meal and will definitely return.",5-May,Excellent,No,,

I had the lamb pasta which was very tasty but a little on the salty side, some of the pasta was stuck together which is unforgivable for a high end restaurant. Dessert redeemed the meal, the home made sorbet was nicely flavored and a refreshing end to the meal. They were not busy and we had a good unhurried catch up over our mains and dessert.

The place has a ""mozzarella bar"" so we tried a couple mozzarella appetizers,which were quite tasty. And then we had to wait quite a long time for the mains. When they finally arrived, we were surprised but not in a pleasant way: the portion sizes are very small for what you pay. If I pay 26 dollars for garganelli bolognese, I don't expect to get a small amuse-bouche sized-dish. It was the same for my friends so we were all quite disappointed. To top it off, we asked for the bill which took a really long time to come, meaning we had to run out to make it in time for our theater show.

The place is nice, the staff were polite, attentive. The Osteria is much better: it has a nice bar counter, soft lighting, simple classic equipment tables, not modest, not excessive; It can &#39;hold, I believe, about fifty seats. I learned that one of the partners is Mr. Bastianich, I was hoping to find fault (ah, ah!) But no! I got an appetizer, a platter of cold cuts and cheese served with fried dough (they call dumpling) and then a first, bavette cheese and pepper, I have to say delicate, not at all fair in heavy firing. nice staff.

(A little slower pace would be worth another 1/2 star if that choice were available, even though I've given 5 stars to each of the categories below.) The menu choices are varied enough to satisfy almost any palate, but weighted toward lighter food. The first course Tuna ?a la Ni‡oise? is outstanding.
